# Reproduction
1. Add oleObject Relationship under `../word/_rels/document.xml.rels` for DOCX, or oleObject OLE2Link for RTF (check test files) to point to a hosted intance of `test.html`.
2. Create CAB file with some utility such as `makecab` or `lcab` and modify `CFILE::szName` to contain a path-transversal (eg: ../payload) and `CFILE::cbFile` with the value `0x415c0000`.
3. Make sure that `test.html` is bigger than `4096 bytes, otherwise the crafted ActiveX Control installation will fail. 
4. Host `test.html` and `pwn.cab` in server.
5. Run DOCX or RTF.
