# Reproduction
1. Add oleObject Relationship under `../word/_rels/document.xml.rels` for DOCX, or a OLE2Link oleObject for RTF (check test files) to point to a hosted intance of `test.html`.
2. Payloads should correspond to any working DLL with any extension. the extension `.inf` has been heavy utilized but is not required.
3. Create CAB file with some utility such as `makecab` or `lcab`:
  3.1. Modify the `CFILE::szName` payload entry in the CAB file to contain a path-transversal (eg: ../payload.inf) in order to extract the file under Temp\Local. 
  3.2. Set the value of `CFILE::cbFile` with the value `0x415c0000` or a value representing a much bigger size than the one of the CAB file to prevent its *deletion* after extraction.
5. It should be pointed out that `test.html` has to be bigger than `4096` bytes for the crafted ActiveX Control installation to work. 
6. Host `test.html` and `pwn.cab` in a server.
7. Run DOCX or RTF.

PS: test documents will expect exploit files (html, cab) to be hosted at `http://127.0.0.1:80/`
